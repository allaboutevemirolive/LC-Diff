Class B126 consists of 4 methods which is 
- addEdge
- findLadders
- dfs 
- addWord

Each of this method has their own purpose. 
The flow of  this code is like below :
```
findLadders 

-> addWord -> addEdge
            
-> dfs
```

Please explain to me this line of code


```
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int u = queue.poll();
            if (u == endWordId) {
                break; 
            }
            if (visited[u]) {
                continue;
            }
            visited[u] = true;
            for (int j = head[u]; j != 0; j = neighborEdges[j]) {
                int v = edges[j];
                if (visited[v]) {
                    continue;
                }
                if (!paths.containsKey(v)) {
                    paths.put(v, new ArrayList<>());
                }
                paths.get(v).add(u);
                queue.add(v);
            }
        }
```
This code is implementing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from a start node to an end node in a graph. The graph in this case is a word ladder, where each node represents a word, and two nodes are connected if their corresponding words differ by only one character.

The while loop runs until the queue is empty, which means that all reachable nodes have been processed. In each iteration, the first node in the queue is removed and assigned to variable u. If u is the endWordId (the ID of the end word), then the loop is terminated with break, as the shortest path has been found. If visited[u] is true, then the node has already been visited, so the loop continues to the next iteration with continue.

If visited[u] is false, then visited[u] is set to true, marking the node as visited. For each neighbor v of u, if visited[v] is false, then a new entry is added to the paths map with v as the key and u as the value. This represents the fact that there is an edge from u to v in the word ladder graph. Finally, v is added to the queue to be processed in the next iteration of the loop.

The purpose of this code is to build the paths map, which will be used later in the code to find all shortest word ladders from the start word to the end word, using Depth-First Search (DFS).

```
    void addEdge(int u, int v) {
        edges[++length] = v;
        neighborEdges[length] = head[u];
        head[u] = length;
    }
```

This code defines a function called addEdge that takes in two integer arguments u and v. The purpose of this function is to add an edge between two nodes u and v in a graph. The implementation assumes that the graph is stored using an adjacency list representation.

The function first increments the length variable by one using the pre-increment operator ++. This variable is used to keep track of the number of edges in the graph. The edges array stores the destination vertex of each edge, so the value of v is added to the edges array at index length.

The neighborEdges array stores the index of the next edge that shares the same source vertex as the current edge. In other words, it stores the index of the next edge in the adjacency list of vertex u. The value of head[u] is assigned to neighborEdges[length], which means that the new edge will have the same source vertex as the previous edge in the list. The head array stores the index of the first edge in the adjacency list of each vertex, so the index length is assigned to head[u]. This means that the new edge is now the first edge in the adjacency list of vertex u.

Overall, this function updates the edges, neighborEdges, and head arrays to add a new edge to the graph.
