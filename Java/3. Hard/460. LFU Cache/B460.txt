This code defines a class called B460 that implements a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache. The LFU cache is a type of cache that evicts the least frequently used items when it reaches its capacity.

The class has several private fields:

capacity: the maximum number of items that can be stored in the cache
size: the current number of items stored in the cache
leastCounter: the least frequency count of any item in the cache
cache: an array to store the items in the cache, indexed by key
counterMap: an array to store the linked list of items for each frequency count
tails: an array to store the tail of each linked list, indexed by frequency count

The class has three public methods:

LFUCache: Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.
get: Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
put: Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present.

The class also has one private method:

incCounter: Increase the frequency count of the item.

The LFUCache method initializes the object with the given capacity and creates three arrays to store the cache, the linked lists of items for each frequency count, and the tail of each linked list.

The get method first checks if the key is in the cache. If the key is in the cache, it increases the frequency count of the item and returns the value of the item. If the key is not in the cache, it returns -1.

The put method first checks if the key is already in the cache. If the key is already in the cache, it increases the frequency count of the item and updates the value and key of the item. If the key is not in the cache and the cache is not full, it creates a new item, sets the frequency count to 1, the value and key of the item, adds the item to the cache, increments the size of the cache, and updates the least frequent counter. If the cache is full, it removes the least frequently used item from the cache.

The incCounter method stores the old count of the node, increments the counter of the node, removes the node from the linked list of the old counter, and adds the node to the linked list of the new counter.

The Time complexity of the get method is O(1) as it only performs constant time operations such as looking up the value in the cache array and incrementing the count.
The Time complexity of the put method is O(1) as it only performs constant time operations such as looking up the value in the cache array, updating the count, adding the node to the linked list, and removing the node from the linked list.
The Time complexity of the incCounter method is O(1) as it only performs constant time operations such as looking up the value in the cache array, updating the count, adding the node to the linked list, and removing the node from the linked list.

The Space complexity of the class is O(n) as it uses three arrays to store n items in the cache, n linked lists of items for each frequency count, and n tails of each linked list, where n is the maximum number of items that can be stored in the cache.
