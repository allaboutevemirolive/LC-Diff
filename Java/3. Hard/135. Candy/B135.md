## Approach:

- We need to distribute candies to n children based on their ratings.
- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
- We need to return the minimum number of candies needed to distribute to all children.

## Algorithm:

- We initialize an array candies of length n with all elements set to 1 (each child must have at least one candy).
- We loop through the ratings array from left to right and update the candies array for each element i such that 
```java
candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1 
if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1] 
```
(i.e., a child with a higher rating gets more candies than their neighbor).
- We loop through the candies array from right to left and update the candies array for each element i such that candies[i] = candies[i+1] + 1 if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] and candies[i] < candies[i+1] + 1 (i.e., we need to satisfy the condition that a child with a higher rating gets more candies than their neighbor, even if that neighbor is on the right).
- We loop through the candies array and compute the sum of all elements, which is the minimum number of candies needed to distribute to all children.

## Time complexity: 
- O(n) as we loop through the array three times.

## Space complexity: 
- O(n) as we create an array candies of length n.

## Edge cases and error handling:

- The code handles the edge cases where n == 1 and ratings array is null or empty by returning 1.

## Test cases:

- Input: [1,0,2], Output: 5
- Input: [1,2,2], Output: 4
- Input: [1], Output: 1
- Input: [], Output: 1

## Optimizations:

- The code is already optimal with time and space complexity of O(n).
- There is no need for optimization as it already meets the problem's constraints.

## Alternative solutions:

- There are other solutions such as using a min-heap or a max-heap to optimize the time complexity to O(nlogn) or using a two-pass approach, but the current solution using three passes is already optimal for this problem.

The comments explain the different parts of the code as follows:

- We initialize the candies array with 1 candy per child.

- We scan the ratings array from left to right, and if the rating of the current child is higher than the rating of the previous child, we give the current child one more candy than the previous child.

- We scan the ratings array from right to left, and if the rating of the current child is higher than the rating of the next child and the current child's current number of candies is less than the next child's current number of candies plus one, we give the current child one more candy than the next child.

- We calculate the total number of candies by summing up the elements of the candies array.

The code runs in `O(n)` time complexity and `O(n)` space complexity.
