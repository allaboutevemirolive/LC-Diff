The class B2 implements a method addTwoNumbers which takes two linked lists as input, each representing a non-negative integer. The digits of the integer are stored in reverse order in the linked lists. The method adds the two integers represented by the linked lists and returns the result as a linked list.

The solution follows the following steps:

Initialize a dummy node dummyNode to store the result and a pointer currentNode to the current node.

Initialize a carry variable carry to 0.

Loop until both input lists are empty and there is no carry left.

Get the value of the current node in each list or set it to 0 if the list is null.

Add the values and the carry, and calculate the new carry.

Create a new node with the last digit of the sum and add it to the result.

Move to the next node in each list.

Return the result without the dummy node.

The code uses a while loop to iterate through the linked lists, adding the values of the current nodes and updating the carry as needed. The result is stored in the linked list, with the dummy node serving as a placeholder. The final result is returned without the dummy node.

_________________________________________________________________________________


The problem is to add two numbers represented by linked lists, where each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order. The goal is to return the sum of the two numbers as a linked list.

Overall Approach

The solution uses a linked list to store the result and a pointer to the current node. It initializes a carry variable to 0 and loops until both input linked lists are empty and there is no carry left. In each iteration, the code gets the value of the current node in each linked list or 0 if the list is null. It then adds the values and the carry, and calculates the new carry. A new node with the last digit of the sum is created and added to the result. The next node in each linked list is then moved to. Finally, the result without the dummy node is returned.

Key Data Structures and Algorithms

Linked List: A data structure used to store the sum of the two numbers
Addition: An arithmetic operation to calculate the sum of two numbers
Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(max(m, n)), where m is the number of nodes in the first linked list and n is the number of nodes in the second linked list. This is because the code loops through both linked lists and performs a constant amount of work in each iteration. The space complexity is O(max(m, n)), as the result linked list is at most one node longer than the longer of the two input linked lists.

Edge Cases and Error Handling

The code assumes that the two numbers do not contain any leading zeros except for 0 itself, as stated in the problem constraints. It also assumes that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

Test Cases

It is a good idea to test the solution with various test cases, including:

Test the solution with the examples from the problem statement
Test the solution with linked lists of different lengths
Test the solution with linked lists that contain the number 0
Test the solution with linked lists where the sum of the digits results in a carry

Optimizations

The code is already optimized in terms of time and space complexity. There are no other optimizations that can be made to this solution.

Alternative Solutions

An alternative solution would be to convert the linked lists to integers, add the two integers, and then convert the result back to a linked list. However, this approach may result in overflow errors for large numbers, as integers have a limited range.

Why you need "carry = sum / 10;" in the code above

"carry = sum / 10" is used to calculate the carry value for the next digit addition. The carry value is the number that needs to be carried over to the next addition if the current sum of the digits is greater than or equal to 10. For example, if the sum of the digits of the current iteration is 18, then the carry value would be 1, and the value of the current node would be 8. The carry value would be added to the next digit during the next iteration. This way, the solution ensures that the correct addition of digits is performed even if the sum of the digits in any iteration exceeds 9.

Why you need this "currentNode.next = new T2(sum % 10);" in the code above

The line "currentNode.next = new T2(sum % 10);" creates a new node in the linked list with the last digit of the sum of the values of the current node in both linked lists and the carry.

For example, if the current nodes in both linked lists have values 3 and 4 respectively, and the carry is 1, then the sum would be 3 + 4 + 1 = 8. The line "currentNode.next = new T2(sum % 10);" creates a new node with the value 8 % 10 = 8. This node is then added to the result linked list.

The purpose of this line is to add the result of the current sum to the linked list representing the final result, which will contain the sum of the two input linked lists in reverse order.
