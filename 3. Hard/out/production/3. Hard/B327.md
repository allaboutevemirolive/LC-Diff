The input array is [-2, 5, -1].

We need to find all the 'contiguous subarrays' and their 'respective sums'.

The contiguous subarrays are: [0,0], [1,1], [2,2], [0,1], [1,2], and [0,2].

The sums of these subarrays are: -2, 5, -1, 3, 4, and 2.

[0,0] = -2

[1,1] = 5

[2,2] = -1

[0,1] : 3 = (-2 + 5)

[1,2] : 4 = (5 + (-1))

[0,2] : 2 = (-2 + 5 + (-1))


We need to find how many of these sums are within the range [-2, 2].

The sums that lie within this range are: 
-2, -1, and 2.

Therefore, there are three subarrays that satisfy the condition: 
[0,0], [2,2], and [0,2].

The given code is a Java implementation of the solution to the LeetCode problem #327 "Count of Range Sum". The problem statement asks to find the number of continuous subarrays in a given array whose sum lies within a given range [lower, upper]. The solution uses a divide and conquer approach with merge sort algorithm and uses long type to prevent overflow.

The solution initializes a long array 'sums' of size n+1 where n is the length of the input 'nums' array. It calculates the prefix sum of the array and stores it in 'sums' where sums[i] contains the sum of elements from nums[0] to nums[i-1]. This helps us to find the sum of a subarray of nums[i, j] as sums[j+1]-sums[i].

The main function 'countRangeSum' calls a helper function 'countWhileMergeSort' with the following arguments: the array 'sums', starting and ending indices of the subarray of 'sums' being considered, and the range [lower, upper]. Initially, we pass the whole 'sums' array to 'countWhileMergeSort' with start=0 and end=n+1.

The helper function 'countWhileMergeSort' recursively splits the 'sums' array into two halves and calls itself for the left and right half. It then counts the number of subarrays whose sum lies within the given range [lower, upper]. It uses three pointers j, k, and t to track the right half of the subarray being considered. Here, 'j' and 'k' start from the midpoint 'mid' and move towards the right end, whereas 't' starts from the midpoint and moves towards the left end.

In each recursive call, 'countWhileMergeSort' counts the number of subarrays whose sum lies in the given range in the current subarray. It calculates the answer by counting the number of subarrays that have at least one element from the left half and at least one element from the right half of the subarray. For this, it compares every element 'sums[i]' of the left half with the elements 'sums[j]' and 'sums[k]' of the right half. Here, if 'sums[i]' is the smallest element that can be used in the subarray, then the range of valid sums for this element in the subarray is [lower+sums[i], upper+sums[i]].

The code handles some edge cases like if the length of the subarray being considered is less than or equal to one, then it returns 0. It also uses an array 'cache' of size end-start to store the sorted subarray.

## Time and Space Complexity:
The time complexity of the solution is O(n*logn) because it uses a divide and conquer approach with merge sort algorithm, where 'n' is the length of the input array. The space complexity of the solution is O(n) because it uses an array of size n+1 to store the prefix sum.

## Edge Cases and Error Handling:
The given code handles the edge cases like if the length of the subarray being considered is less than or equal to one, then it returns 0.

## Test cases:
To test the implementation, we can create test cases with different input arrays, lower and upper bounds and verify if the output of the function matches the expected output. For instance:

```
int[] nums1 = {-2, 5, -1};
int lower1 = -2;
int upper1 = 2;
B327 b = new B327();
int output1 = b.countRangeSum(nums1, lower1, upper1);
int expectedOutput1 = 3;
assert output1 == expectedOutput1;

int[] nums2 = {0};
int lower2 = 0;
int upper2 = 0;
int output2 = b.countRangeSum(nums2, lower2, upper2);
int expectedOutput2 = 1;
assert output2 == expectedOutput2;
```

## Optimizations:

The implementation uses merge sort, which guarantees a worst-case time complexity of O(n*log(n)). The space complexity is O(n) to store the array of sums. The implementation also uses a cache to store the sorted array while merging, which helps to reduce the number of unnecessary comparisons.

## Alternative solutions:

There are other ways to solve this problem. One approach is to use a segment tree to store the sum of intervals and query the number of intervals that fall within the [lower, upper] range. The time complexity for this approach is also O(nlog(n)), but the space complexity is O(nlog(n)) due to the size of the segment tree. Another approach is to use a balanced binary search tree like AVL or Red-Black tree to store the sum of intervals and query the number of intervals that fall within the [lower, upper] range. The time complexity for this approach is also O(n*log(n)), but the space complexity is O(n) due to the size of the binary search tree.
