The code defines a class B115 which contains a public method numDistinct that takes two string arguments s and t. The method returns an integer, which represents the number of distinct subsequences of string s that equal string t.

The algorithm for computing the number of distinct subsequences is implemented using dynamic programming. It creates two arrays of integers, dp and temp, each of length tLength + 1, where tLength is the length of string t.

Initially, the first value of both arrays is set to 1. The array dp will store the number of distinct subsequences of s that equal t. The array temp is used to help update the values in dp.

Then, the code loops through each character in string s using a for loop. Within this loop, it loops through each character in string t using another for loop. For each character in s, it checks if it matches the current character in t. If it does, it updates the value of dp at index j by adding the value of temp at index j-1. If it doesn't match, it simply updates the value of temp at index j-1 with the previous value of dp at index j-1.

Finally, the method returns the final value of dp at index tLength, which represents the number of distinct subsequences of s that equal t.

In summary, the code above provides an implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm for computing the number of distinct subsequences of a string s that equal another string t. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(nm), where n and m are the lengths of the strings s and t, respectively.


_______________________________________________


The overall approach of this code is to count the number of distinct subsequences of string s that are equal to string t. A subsequence of s is a sequence of characters from s that may not be contiguous, but must appear in the same order as they do in t.

The key algorithm used in this code is dynamic programming. The code builds a 2D array to store the intermediate results and calculates the final result by updating the array.

The key data structures used in this code are two arrays of integers: dp and temp. dp stores the number of distinct subsequences of s that are equal to t, while temp is used to help update dp.

The time complexity of this code is O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of strings s and t, respectively. The space complexity is O(n), which is the length of the target string t.

The code handles the edge cases where the length of s or t is less than or equal to 1. If either string is empty, the code returns 0.

Test cases:

Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 distinct subsequences of s that are equal to t: "rabbit", "rabbit", and "rabbit".

Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 distinct subsequences of s that are equal to t: "bag", "bag", "bag", "bag", and "bag".

Input: s = "", t = "abc"
Output: 0
Explanation: The empty string cannot contain any subsequences of "abc".

Input: s = "abc", t = ""
Output: 1
Explanation: The empty string is a subsequence of any string.

Optimizations: The code can be optimized by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array to store intermediate results.

Alternative solutions: Another approach to solve this problem is using recursive algorithms such as backtracking or memoization. However, dynamic programming is more efficient in this case.
