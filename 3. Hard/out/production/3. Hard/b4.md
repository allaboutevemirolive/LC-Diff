This code defines a public class "B0004" which contains a single public static method "findMedianSortedArrays()". This method takes in two input arrays "nums1" and "nums2" which are assumed to be sorted in ascending order. The method's purpose is to find the median (middle value) of the combined array of "nums1" and "nums2".

The method first declares two local variables "m" and "n", which store the length of "nums1" and "nums2" respectively. Then, if the length of "nums1" is greater than "nums2", the method calls itself recursively with the two input arrays swapped. This ensures that the input array with the smaller length will always be passed as the first argument.

The method then initializes two local variables "low" and "high" to 0 and the length of "nums1" respectively, and uses these variables for a binary search algorithm. The algorithm repeatedly partitions both input arrays and calculates the median of the combined array based on the partition indices.

The method uses a while loop that continues as long as "low" is less than or equal to "high". Within the while loop, the method calculates the partition indices for both input arrays using the formula "partitionX = (low + high) / 2" and "partitionY = (m + n + 1) / 2 - partitionX". These indices determine the partition point for both arrays.

The method then uses these partition indices to calculate the "maxLeftX", "minRightX", "maxLeftY" and "minRightY", which represent the maximum value of the left partition of "nums1", minimum value of the right partition of "nums1", maximum value of the left partition of "nums2" and minimum value of the right partition of "nums2" respectively.

The method then checks if the following condition is satisfied: maxLeftX <= minRightY && maxLeftY <= minRightX. If this condition is true, it means that the partition point has been found and the method can calculate the median of the combined array. The median is calculated differently depending on whether the combined array has an odd or even number of elements. If the combined array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. If the combined array has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element.

If the condition is not true, the method uses the values of "minRightY" and "maxLeftX" to determine whether it needs to move to the left or right of the partition point. If "maxLeftX" is greater than "minRightY", the method moves to the left of the partition point by reducing the value of "high" to "partitionX - 1". If "maxLeftX" is less than "minRightY", the method moves to the right of the partition point by increasing the value of "low" to "partitionX + 1".

The while loop continues until the partition point is found or "low" becomes greater than "high", in which case the method throws an "IllegalArgumentException" as it assumes that the input arrays are not sorted.
