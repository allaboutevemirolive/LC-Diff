Why initialize dict with 5001?

The dict array is used to store boolean values that indicate whether a string of a particular length is present in the input array. It is initialized to size 5001 because the constraints specify that the length of each string in the input array is at most 300, and there can be at most 5000 strings in the input array.

Therefore, dict array has a length of 5001 to account for the case where the input array contains only one empty string, which has a length of 0.
