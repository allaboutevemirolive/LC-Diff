This program demonstrates the use of a method called `getMax()` that takes an integer array and an integer k as input parameters, and returns the top k maximum values from the input array in the form of an integer array.

In the `main()` method, an integer array `nums` and an integer `k` are initialized with some random values. The `getMax()` method is then called by passing `nums` and `k` as arguments, and the returned result is stored in an integer array called `result`. Finally, the contents of the `result` array are printed using the `Arrays.toString()` method.

The `getMax()` method works by first initializing an empty integer array called `result` with a size equal to `k`. It then uses a loop over the input array `nums` to find the top k maximum values. Inside this loop, it uses another loop (a while loop) to compare each element of the input array with the elements in the `result` array to determine if it should be included in the final output.

The primary logic behind finding the top k maximum values lies in the use of this while loop that compares the current element with the elements already present in the `result` array. If the current element is greater than the last element in the `result` array and there are still more elements left in `nums` that can potentially be added to the `result` array, we discard the last element in the `result` array and move on to the next index (index - 1) until we find a correct location to insert the current element. We keep doing this until either all the elements in `nums` have been processed or the `result` array has been filled up completely.

Finally, we return the `result` array, which contains the k maximum values from the input array `nums`.
