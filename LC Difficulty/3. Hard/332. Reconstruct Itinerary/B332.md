What is "smallest lexical order when read as a single string" in the problem below?
```
In the problem "Reconstruct Itinerary", "smallest lexical order when read as a single string" refers to the lexicographically smallest possible itinerary that can be constructed from the given list of airline tickets. Lexicographically smallest means that if there are multiple possible itineraries, the one that comes first in alphabetical order (when considered as a single string) should be returned.

For example, if there are two possible itineraries: ["JFK", "LGA"] and ["JFK", "LGB"], then the first one has a smaller lexical order and should be returned. In other words, when the two itineraries are concatenated as strings, the first character of the first itinerary is "J" which comes before "L" (the first character of the second itinerary) in the alphabet.
