```
In the context of the problem, the array [2, 9, 10] represents a building. The values in the array have the following meanings:

- 2 is the x-coordinate of the left edge of the building.
- 9 is the x-coordinate of the right edge of the building.
- 10 is the height of the building.

So, [2, 9, 10] means there is a building that starts at x-coordinate 2, ends at x-coordinate 9, and has a height of 10.
