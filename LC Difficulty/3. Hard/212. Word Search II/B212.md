```
What do the letters "i" and "j" in the code above mean?
```

`i` is used to iterate through the `rows` of the board.

`j` is used to iterate through the `columns` of the board.

What does "idx" stand for in the code below?
```
In the code above, `idx` stands for the 

- index of the current character being searched for in the recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. 

It is used to keep track of the progress made in searching for a particular word on the board. The DFS algorithm is used to check if a given word can be constructed from the letters on the board by searching for each character of the word in the neighbouring cells of the current cell. If the character is found, the DFS algorithm is called recursively with the index of the next character in the word incremented by one. If the end of the word is reached, the algorithm returns true, indicating that the word has been found on the board.
