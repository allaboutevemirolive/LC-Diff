## Overview

The given code is a solution for "Patching Array" problem, which requires inserting the minimum number of elements into a sorted array so that every value in [1,n] range can be obtained by summing a combination of values within the array. 

The main idea behind this approach is to start with an empty array and incrementally add missing number ranges while keeping track of the maximum possible reachable value that has been covered so far. The algorithm operates iteratively through the input list until all needed numbers have been accounted for.

## Approach:

The approach taken by the given code involves identifying missing ranges in the input array that need to be patched to enable a complete sequence of numbers up to n. It accomplishes this by starting with an empty sequence, keeps track of the maximum achievable value using previous values in the sequence, and then incrementally adds subsequent elements to the sequence to fill any gaps between the current maximum achievable value and the next element in the input sequence.

- Initialize an integer variable `i` to 0 to index through the array
- Initialize a long variable `maxReachableValue` to 1 (long is used to prevent overflow when multiplying).
- Initialize an integer `patch` variable to track how many patches are needed.
- While `maxReachableValue` is less than or equal to `n`: 
    - If the current maxReachableValue is less than the current element in the array or we have reached the end of the array:
        - Double `maxReachableValue` and add a patch to the array
    - Else, if the current maxReachableValue is greater than or equal to the current element in the array:
        - Add the current element to the current maxReachableValue and move to the next element.
- return `patch`.

## Complexity:

- Time complexity: O(N) where N is the length of nums.
    - The code iterates through the num array once giving a time complexity of O(N).
- Space complexity: O(1)
    - The memory usage is constant. There are no extra data structures created.

## Edge Cases:

- If `n` is less than or equal to the first element in the array, there will be no missing numbers and hence no patches required. 

## Test Cases:

| Test | Input | Output |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | nums = [1,3], n = 6 | 1 |
| 2 | nums = [1,5,10], n = 20 | 2 |
| 3 | nums = [1,2,2], n = 5 | 0 |

## Optimizations:

No additional optimizations can be made to this code as it runs at O(N) which is optimal, given that we have to check each number in the input array. 

## Alternative Solution:

The problem can also be solved using a Greedy algorithm where we keep track of the maximum achievable sum with the current set of elements. Whenever we encounter a number greater than this sum, insert the previous sum+1 into the list and repeat until we find a value greater than `n`.

```Python
def minPatches(nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:
    curr_sum = 0
    patches = 0
    i = 0
    
    while curr_sum < n:
        if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= curr_sum + 1:
            curr_sum += nums[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            curr_sum += (curr_sum + 1)
            patches += 1
            
    return patches
```
