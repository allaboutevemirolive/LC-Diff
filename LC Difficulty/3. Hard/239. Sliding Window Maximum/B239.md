Important rules that are implemented in the code above:

1. The sliding window moves from left to right through the input array.

2. The size of the sliding window is k.

3. The current window is represented by a deque data structure.

4. Elements are added to the back of the deque and removed from the front.

5. The deque always stores indices rather than the values themselves.

6. Indices of elements that are outside the current window are removed from the deque.

7. Indices of elements that are smaller than the current element are removed from the deque.

8. The maximum value of the current window is always the first element of the deque.

9. When a new element is added to the deque, smaller elements at the back of the deque are removed.

10. The maximum value of the current window is added to the result array when the window is at position k-1 or greater.
