This code builds a binary tree from its inorder and postorder traversals. The inorder traversal is used to determine the relative positions of nodes in the tree, while the postorder traversal is used to determine the root node and to divide the tree into its left and right subtrees. The code does this by recursively building each subtree and returning the root node for each subtree.

The postorderIndex and inorderIndex variables keep track of the current index in the postorder and inorder arrays, respectively. The buildTree method sets these indices to the end of the arrays and then calls the buildTreeHelper method to recursively build the tree.

The buildTreeHelper method takes three arguments: the inorder array, the postorder array, and a stopValue. The stopValue is the value that indicates the end of the current subtree. When the inorder array contains this value, the current subtree has been completely processed, and the method returns null to indicate that there are no more nodes to process.

If there are still nodes to process, the method gets the next node value from the postorder array and creates a new TreeNode object for it. The root.right and root.left fields of the TreeNode object are then set to the right and left subtrees of the current node, respectively. The right subtree is built by calling buildTreeHelper recursively with the current rootValue as the stopValue. The left subtree is built by calling buildTreeHelper recursively with the original stopValue. Finally, the method returns the completed TreeNode object for the current subtree.
