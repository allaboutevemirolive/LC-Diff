This code is a Java implementation of a solution to the problem of finding the number of unique paths a robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner of an m x n grid, given that the robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

The approach used in this solution is dynamic programming, which is a method for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computation.

Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

int[] dp = new int[n];: This line creates an array named "dp" with a size of "n" and initializes it with default values (0 for integers). This array will be used to store the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to each cell in the grid.

Arrays.fill(dp, 1);: This line uses the static method "fill" of the "Arrays" class to fill the entire "dp" array with the value 1. This is the initial condition for the problem, as the robot starts at the top-left corner and there is only one way to reach it.

for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {: This loop iterates through the rows of the grid, starting from the second row (i = 1) and going up to the m-1-th row.

for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {: This loop iterates through the columns of the grid, starting from the second column (j = 1) and going up to the n-1-th column.

dp[j] += dp[j - 1];: This line uses the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of unique paths to the current cell (i, j) by adding the number of paths to the cell above it (i, j-1) and the number of paths to the cell to the left of it (i-1, j). The result is then stored in the dp array at the position j.

return dp[n - 1];: This line returns the last element of the dp array, which is the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m*n) and the space complexity is O(n) as we are using an array of size n.

Overall, the solution uses an array dp of size n and fills it with the initial value 1, which is the number of ways to reach the first cell from the origin. It then uses two nested loops to iterate through the grid, and for each cell, calculates the number of ways to reach that cell from the origin by adding the number of ways to reach the cell above and the cell to the left. This solution saves the number of ways to reach each cell in the dp array and returns the last element of the dp array which is the number of ways to reach the last cell.

The dynamic approach will always start calculate the unique paths on (1,1) which is 2(see how the formula replace it with 2). 

Assuming that each of the box fill 1 and the formula :

dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j-1]

will change number 1 for each box with new value by adding current value with value in box before it

But instead of using new cell with new value, the formula REUSE the OLD cell and OLD value and replace it with new value


Initial value : dp  0  1   2
     
actual value  : dp  1  1   1

     line 1   : dp  1  2#  3#

     line 2   : dp  1  3#  6#


Line 1 :

1 + 1 = 2#

2# + 1(actual value) = 3# (replace 1)



Line 2 :

1 + 2(Line 1) = 3#

3 + 3(line 1) = 6
