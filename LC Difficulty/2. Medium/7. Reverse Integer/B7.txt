The code above is a Java implementation of the reverse integer problem. Given a signed 32-bit integer, the program returns the integer with its digits reversed. The solution uses a while loop to iterate through each digit of the input number and reverse it.

Here's how it works step-by-step:

Initialize a variable "reversed" to store the reversed integer and set it to 0.

Start a while loop that continues until all digits of the input number have been processed.

In each iteration, get the last digit of the input number by performing the modulo operation number % 10.

Next, calculate the potential reversed integer by multiplying the current reversed integer with 10 and adding the last digit.

Check if there was an overflow during the calculation by comparing the value of (potentialReversed - lastDigit) / 10 with the current reversed integer. If an overflow occurred, the program returns 0.

Update the reversed integer with the new value of potentialReversed.

Remove the last digit from the input number by performing integer division number / 10.

Repeat steps 3 to 7 until all digits of the input number have been processed.

Finally, return the reversed integer.

Note: The reason the program checks for an overflow is because the input is a signed 32-bit integer and its reverse could exceed the range of a signed 32-bit integer. The code returns 0 in such cases to indicate that the reverse would result in an overflow.

Why you need the code below




if ((potentialReversed - lastDigit) / 10 != reversed) { 
// check if there was overflow during the calculation
return 0; // overflow, return 0
}



The code if ((potentialReversed - lastDigit) / 10 != reversed) checks for overflow during the calculation of the reversed integer. If the result of this condition is true, it means that the reversed integer has overflowed the 32-bit signed integer range of [-231, 231 - 1].

In such a case, returning 0 indicates that the result is invalid and can't be represented within the specified range. The value 0 was chosen as the return value in this case because it is outside the range of the possible results for a reversed integer, making it an easy way to indicate an error.

Give me test case that would lead to overflow


One example of an input that would lead to overflow is 1534236469. When this number is reversed, the result is 9646324351, which is greater than 2147483647, the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.

Here's how the calculation would look like in the code:

makefile
Copy code
number = 1534236469
reversed = 0

// First iteration
lastDigit = number % 10 = 9
potentialReversed = reversed * 10 + lastDigit = 9
reversed = potentialReversed = 9
number = number / 10 = 153423646

// Second iteration
lastDigit = number % 10 = 6
potentialReversed = reversed * 10 + lastDigit = 96
reversed = potentialReversed = 96
number = number / 10 = 15342364

// ...

// Ninth iteration
lastDigit = number % 10 = 5
potentialReversed = reversed * 10 + lastDigit = 964632435
reversed = potentialReversed = 964632435
number = number / 10 = 1534236

// Tenth iteration
lastDigit = number % 10 = 6
potentialReversed = reversed * 10 + lastDigit = 9646324356
reversed = potentialReversed = 9646324356
number = number / 10 = 153423

// Eleventh iteration
lastDigit = number % 10 = 3
potentialReversed = reversed * 10 + lastDigit = 96463243563
reversed = potentialReversed = 96463243563
number = number / 10 = 15342

// ...

// Sixteenth iteration
lastDigit = number % 10 = 4
potentialReversed = reversed * 10 + lastDigit = 96463243564534
reversed = potentialReversed = 96463243564534
number = number / 10 = 153

// ...

// Nineteenth iteration
lastDigit = number % 10 = 3
potentialReversed = reversed * 10 + lastDigit = 96463243564534153
reversed = potentialReversed = 96463243564534153
number = number / 10 = 15

// Twentieth iteration
lastDigit = number % 10 = 5
potentialReversed = reversed * 10 + lastDigit = 964632435645341535
// potentialReversed - lastDigit = 964632435645341530 != reversed = 96463243564534153
// overflow, return 0
return 0
