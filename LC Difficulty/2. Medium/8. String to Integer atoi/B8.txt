Please explain to me the question below like I am 12



Okay! So imagine you want to convert a string of characters into a number, like "42" into the number 42. That's what this question is about. It's asking you to write a program that does this conversion for you.

The program will have to follow these steps:

Ignore any spaces at the start of the string.

If the next character is "+" or "-", remember if the number should be positive or negative. If there's no "+" or "-", assume it's positive.

Keep reading characters until you reach a non-digit character or the end of the string. The rest of the string you can ignore.

Convert the characters you just read into a number. For example, "123" becomes 123 and "0032" becomes 32.

Check if the number is too big or too small to fit in a 32-bit signed integer. If it's too big, make it the largest number that fits. If it's too small, make it the smallest number that fits.

Return the final number as the result.


For example, if the input is "42", the program should return 42 because 42 fits in a 32-bit signed integer. If the input is " -42", the program should return -42 because "42" is converted to 42 and then made negative because of the "-" sign. If the input is "4193 with words", the program should return 4193 because "4193" is converted to 4193 and the rest of the string is ignored.

For each of the step you give above, give me example

Sure! Here are examples for each step of the myAtoi(string s) function:

Read in and ignore any leading whitespace:

Input: " 42"
Output: "42" (The two leading spaces were ignored)


Check for a positive or negative sign:

Input: "+42"
Output: "+" (The leading "+" was read in, indicating the result should be positive)

Input: "-42"
Output: "-" (The leading "-" was read in, indicating the result should be negative)


Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached:

Input: "42 with words"
Output: "42" (The characters "42" were read in until the next non-digit character, which is a space)


Convert the digits into an integer:

Input: "42"
Output: 42 (The string "42" was converted into the integer 42)


Change the sign if necessary:

Input: "-42"
Output: -42 (The sign was changed to negative because a "-" was read in step 2)


Clamp the integer if it's out of range:

Input: "2147483648" (a number larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer)
Output: 2147483647 (The number was clamped to the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer, which is 2147483647)


Return the integer as the final result:

Input: 42
Output: 42 (The final result is the integer 42)
