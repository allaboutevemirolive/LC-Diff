The output in the terminal is 



0 -3 -10 9 5 



But the output in the question is

0,-3,9,-10,null,5



Why is this happen? Am i missing something?


The output format in the terminal and the expected output in the question are different. 

The expected output in the question is in the form of a binary tree, where each node has a left and right child or a null value if it does not have a child. 

The output in the terminal is in the form of a space-separated list of node values in the order of an inorder traversal of the tree.

To better match the expected output in the question, you could modify your main function to output the binary tree in a format that shows the structure of the tree, using null for missing child nodes. Here's an example implementation that outputs the tree in the expected format:

public static void printTree(T109 root) {
    if (root == null) {
        System.out.print("null ");
        return;
    }
    System.out.print(root.val + " ");
    printTree(root.left);
    printTree(root.right);
}


This implementation recursively traverses the tree in preorder, printing the value of each node followed by its left and right subtrees, each enclosed in a set of brackets. If a subtree is null, it is printed as "null". When this function is called on the root of the tree, it will output the tree in the expected format.
